table2,Table 1.,"SNaX Program Fixed And Variable Costs Over A Five Week Program Period
Hours/week, based on average teacher or cafeteria employee wages
Variable costs vary with number of students enrolled in the school
Varies with number of peer leaders
Total costs calculated by multiplying Items per week x No. of weeks x Cost per item (e.g. Peer leader tips/informational guides: 18 items/week x 5 weeks x $0.83/item = $75.10)
Note: As an example, the first entry (“Training facilitator to deliver SNaX program*) is interpreted as follows: 15 hours were spent in one week to train the facilitator, at a cost of $45.01 per hour, for a total fixed cost of $675.09"
table3,Table 2.,"Cost-effectiveness And Average Cost Of SNaX Based On Fruit And Vegetable Servings, Cafeteria Participation, And Snack Sales Per Student Over Five Week Program Period
Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; Avg., average; CE, cost-effectiveness
Note: Incremental change represents adjusted differences-in-differences estimate of pre-to-post change within and between control and intervention schools
As an example for interpretive purposes, each student, on average, ate 1.75 more fruits over the five week period. Achieving this goal, per student, cost $1.20 per fruit consumed.
Vegetable outcomes were not included in economic evaluation because there was no statistically significant intervention effect
Includes 5 schools only (2 intervention and 3 control schools); because of the high number of students who were eligible for the NSLP in 4 schools, LAUSD allowed all students to receive free meals at those schools. NSLP data were not collected for one intervention school.
Excludes one control school; one school’s store was closed due to structural damage."
